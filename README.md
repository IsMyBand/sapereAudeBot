From now on, inside this package, **Lucy is software**. Alice and Bob are for agents, two humans and two TIC devices that will only support Lucy's topics and soon will be deprecated. So, target is Lucy.

**Alice** can be both an IoT thing and also a brilliant CEO at Silicon Valley TIC building. **Bob**, also, like Alice, can be both a broker cluster and also and indian working sysadmin at Bangladesh just beside his mom and cousins, on a middle-class neighbour.

Alice is working on Alice. Bob is working on Bob. Meaning that the northamerican tech girl is working on a so called Debian 9 distribution **Alice like a virtual machine with MQTT clients plugged to some things; like a M2M control panel**. While indian tech supports **Bob as a network of brokers, mainly Kafka clusters to Alice clients, MQTT hive**. 

Over them, **Lucy is just a conversational bot** that knows how to serve humans to operate on its **things control panel**. Something like a neuronal network who uses AIML to present some what a mind operating as an smart office assistant.

Lucy is born after Microsoft PC and Apple's machines. IBM and so big corporates were doing the industry on new born machines and Gates or Jobs just pulled the IT to home and domestic topics. Just a mention to Apple 1. 

But let this README go straight to Lucy. **Think on Lisa as Lucy's grandmother: Apple Lisa is a desktop computer developed by Apple, released on January 19, 1983**. It was one of the first personal computers to offer a graphical user interface (GUI) in a machine aimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978, and it underwent many changes during the development period before shipping at the very high price of US$9,995 with a 5 MB hard drive. The high price, relatively low performance and unreliable "Twiggy" floppy disks led to poor sales, with only 100,000 units sold.

Consider AIML as the language of machine's soul when Lucy is able to achieve Office clip, the visual assistant, best marks and go further to a new generation of multimedia and hiperlink writters. At some point Lucy is just a helper bot while the user plugs and unplugs its machines to her desk.

**Lucy just adds to common desktop staff, over Plug'Play, some 3D and object projections over hologram and recognition Kinect-like cams**. At an office where Lucy works could be played some hiperreality staff, sensors and projections furniture over floor or walls or just inside rooms emptiness. 

Domotics for home and inmotics for buildings is top face of this office where Lucy can help as a conversational bot than can manipulate amazing USB, Bluetooth or radio devices inside the office towards MQTT broadcasting to its smartcity entripoints. A bunch of Things are being connected to the environtment and only who listens will hear.

Just to bring this code over lirics and literature let me introduce the enlightment on Alice and Bob who were married on november fifth 2000. Just met together at Picadilly Circus. She was doing some research on The City about how to teach Lucy to plug financial broker over its databases. Alice desires that Alice thing would able to broke buying and selling futures over the global markets. Bob is also visiting this centric english square because of a negotiation with a provider that offers internet connection and PAAS. Bob is pretending to play the Apache Kafka adventure with a so called Bob MQTT brokers cluster.

So Bob and Alice met together at Picadilly and Alice is born five years later while Bob is born seven. 2005 and 2007 are Alice's Debian distro and Bob's broker cluster birthday starting date. Lucy comes on 2011, just a bit after Alice and Bot stablished and stabilized telemetry transport channel. Just Alice keeping humans and machines messages and Bob distributing them to other Alice's is something like a Lucy door to earth. A converstational bot that is able to talk to the web while a human is chating towards the screen is huge amazing when this bot also can change some machine state or behaving.

At some point Alice and Bob will split forking out this repo and Lucy will be left alone. See milestones to keep the track. While Alice and Bob are logic agents they both represents the network where Lucy can keep its periferics brilliant and full of lights and data on a day by day job at office.

Let's work!

At the end, Lucy is an Alice bot, while Bob is an MQTT network.
