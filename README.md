From now on, inside this package, Lucy is software. Alice can be both an IoT thing and also a brilliant CEO at Silicon Valley TIC building. Bob, also, like Alice, can be both a broker cluster and also and indian working sysadmin at Bangladesh just beside his mom and cousins, on a middle-class neighbour.

Alice is working on Alice. Bob is working on Bob. Meaning that northamerican tech girl is working on a so called Debian 9 distribution Alice. While indian tech supports Bob brokers to Alice clients, MQTT hive is supporting something logic on a Lucy as a neuronal network and office assistant.

Lucy is born after Microsoft PC and Apple's machines. IBM and so big corporates were doing the industry on new born machines and Gates or Jobs just pulled the IT to home and domestic topics. Just a mention to Apple 1:

*El Apple I fue uno de los primeros computadores personales, y el primero en combinar un microprocesador con una conexión para un teclado y un monitor. Fue diseñado y hecho a mano por Steve Wozniak1​2​ originalmente para uso personal. Un amigo de Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, tuvo la idea de vender el computador. Fue el primer producto de Apple, demostrado en abril de 1976 en el Homebrew Computer Club en Palo Alto, California.*

*
    CPU: MOS Technology 6502 @ aproximadamente 1 MHz.
    RAM: 4 KB estándar, expandible a 8 KB en la tarjeta o hasta 48 KiB usando tarjetas de expansión (productos de terceros).
    ROM: 256 bytes, en donde residía el programa monitor, un pequeño programa escrito en lenguaje ensamblador.
    Gráficos: 40×24 caracteres, con scrolling implementado en hardware.

But let this README go straight to Lucy. Think on Lisa as Lucy's grandmother:

Apple Lisa is a desktop computer developed by Apple, released on January 19, 1983. It was one of the first personal computers to offer a graphical user interface (GUI) in a machine aimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978,[2] and it underwent many changes during the development period before shipping at the very high price of US$9,995 with a 5 MB hard drive. The high price, relatively low performance and unreliable "Twiggy" floppy disks led to poor sales, with only 100,000 units sold.

Lucy just adds to common desktop staff, over Plug'Play, some 3D and object projections over hologram and recognition Kinect-like cams. And office where Lucy works could be played some hiperreality staff, sensors and projections furniture over floor or walls or just inside rooms emptiness. Domotics for home and inmotics for buildings is top face of this office where Lucy can help as a conversational bot than can manipulate amazing USB, Bluetooth or radio devices inside the office towards MQTT broadcasting to its smartcity entripoints.

Alice and Bob were married on november fifth 2000. Just met together at Picadilly Circus. She vas doing some research on The City about how to teach Lucy to plug financial broker over its databases. Alice desires that Alice thing is able to broke buying and selling futures over the global markets. Bob is also this centric english square because of a negotiation with a provider that offers internet connection and PAAS. Bob is pretending to play the Apache Kafka thing with a so called Bob MQTT brokers cluster.

At some point Alice and Bob will split forking out this repo and Lucy will be left alone. See milestones to keep the track. While Alice and Bob are logic agents they both represents the network where Lucy can keep its periferics brilliant and full of lights and data.

At the end, Lucy is an Alice bot, while Bob is an MQTT network.
